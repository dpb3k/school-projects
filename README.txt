This program uses polyalphabetic cipher and rail fence cipher to encrypt or decrypt a plaintext file.

The file that you want to be running is the main.py file by typing this in the command line while in the same directory
as the main.py file.
    python3 main.py

Once done, an input prompt should show up asking if you want to perform polyalphabetic cipher or rail fence cipher.
Please enter 'pc' if you want to choose polyalphabetic cipher and enter 'rfc' if you want to choose rail fence cipher.

(Polyalphabetic Cipher)
If you choose polyalphabetic cipher it will ask for a plaintext file. I have provided one called plaintext.txt
Type the text file including the extension with .txt

It should proceed to output into the command line window with the encrypted message (ciphertext) into a new file called
pc_encrypted.txt and the decrypted message (plaintext) into a file called pc_decrypted.txt.


(Rail Fence Cipher)
If you choose Rail Fence Cipher it will ask for the depth and the text file you choose to encrypt or decrypt.
Please enter the option for encrypt as 'e' and for decrypt type 'd'.
Type the text file including the extension with .txt

When encryption is finished, it will output encrypted message to a file called rfc_encrypted.txt.
Then choose to decrypt and when it asks for a file, enter rfc_encrypted.txt
The decrypted message will be in rfc_decrypted.txt
